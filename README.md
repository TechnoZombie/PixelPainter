Based on an exercise made during #93rd bootcamp at Academia de CÃ³digo / CodeForAll_ bootcamp, this is a paint-like program based on grid coordinates.
It uses simple-graphics as a graphics library ( https://github.com/academia-de-codigo/simple-graphics )

It has since been highly modified and enhanced, using a customized version of simple-graphics.
